# news-api-email 📰
These scripts will send you a daily email about news with your favorite topics 🌐
Here is an example of the expected output:

![news-git](https://github.com/Mburg03/news-api-email/assets/90336061/881f83ab-973b-4008-8c2a-244b977cf9d2)

In this case my favorite topic actually is AI, so I get daily an email with the top 20 news of the day with a title, small description and the link where you can read more about it.
You can customize what you would like your emails to be about on the main.py file, just change the variable topic with whatever you want! ✌️
